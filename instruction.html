  Playing Hangman against a computer involves the computer selecting a word, and you will be attempting to guess it letter by letter. The computer will show the length of the word with blank spaces, and you will make guesses by suggesting letters. If the guessed letter is in the word, the computer reveals its position; if not, the computer increments an incorrect guesses counter and begins drawing a hangman figure. The player continues guessing until they either successfully identify the word or exceed the maximum allowed incorrect guesses. The challenge lies in deducing the word with as few mistakes as possible, adding an element of suspense as the hangman figure progressively unfolds on the screen. You will only have 6 tries until the full body is revealed and you lose. Last thing there are 8 different categories and they are randomized, have fun!
