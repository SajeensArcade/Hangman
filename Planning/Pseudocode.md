Create buttons to enter the game from the main arcade
Im gonna need a variable to that is an empty string so we can put whatever the computer's word in that empty string. 
prompt user to enter a letter
if they dont get the letter correct I will un hide the face and it will go on etc until the full body is revealed (6 tries for user)
They will only be able to guess one letter at a time
If they guess the right letter i will unhide the letter to the user
If they get it wrong I will unhide the head and will replace the image over time.
